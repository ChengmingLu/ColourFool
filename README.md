This is a simple tile-matching game which is highly customizable.
An algotithm has been devised so that a matrix of squares of n x m can be generated.
This game is more of a template for other features to be implemented.
Current features include:
    1. Easy-to-implement tile-matching rules
    2. Maintainable difficulty
    3. A timer and a score keeper
    etc.
